This is the minimap that goes in the bottom right corner of the screen. 
It displays the location of all the enemies, as well as the player. 

Currently I'm thinking that the best way to do this is to just spawn in some 
gameobjects that represent the enemies. 

Update. I've thought about this more, and I do believe that this is the best way
to go about things. I really hate how Unity is making something simple very complicated.

On second thought, let's try this with the RenderTexture feature.
